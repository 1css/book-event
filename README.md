# Book Event
The Book Event project is a web application that allows users to view and book events. Users can see event details like title, date, price, and available seats. They can easily navigate to the event details page by clicking on an event. The application also checks if a user has already booked an event. If not, they can complete their booking and receive a confirmation. This project helps users easily manage their event bookings in a simple and user-friendly way.
This project is a web application built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for managing and booking events.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
### `git clone https://github.com/1css/book-event.git`

Step 2: Navigate to Project Directory
Change your directory to the cloned project folder:


### `cd book-event`

Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies by running:
### `npm install`

Step 4: Run the Application
To start the application in development mode, use:


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
